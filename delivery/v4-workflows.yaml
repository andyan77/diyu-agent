# V4 Phase 1 Build Orchestration Workflows
# Machine-readable definitions for the 7-WF pipeline.
#
# Architecture:
#   WF-P0 (prereq) -> WF-A1 (gate entry) -> WF-B{1..4} (build) -> WF-A2 (gate exit)
#
# Relation to existing governance pipeline (W1-W4 in taskcard-governance):
#   W1-W4 is a VALIDATION pipeline (schema + traceability + acceptance + evidence gate).
#   WF-P0~A2 is a BUILD pipeline (fix + validate + implement + verify).
#   WF-A1 and WF-A2 invoke the W1-W4 governance pipeline as part of their checks.
#
# User-level agents (/plan, /tdd, code-reviewer, etc.) are optional enhancements.
# The pipeline MUST work without them. When available, they improve quality.
